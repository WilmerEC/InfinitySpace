# InfinitySpace
Level renderer where the only limit is your imagination!


# Requirements:
To test & run source code, you have to download GLFW, GLM, & Vulkan SDK.
In case you're using Visual Studio, here's a link to the official setup in Vulkan's
website. If you're using a different IDE, you need to add the include folders, libraries &
dependencies for Vulkan, GLFW & GLM and change C++ version to C++ 17 or later.

# Disclaimer:
Please bare in mind any code anyone ever writes can always be written better;
by this I mean all feedback is welcome as long as it's constructive and not
harsh, unproductive criticism.

New updates are always coming to this project as it's a hobby and portfolio piece
I'll slowly but surely be adding onto as time goes by. Feel free to contact me if you
have any ideas on how to make it better, if you want to do a collab, or if you want to improve it!
